sunk cost fallacy

[How the Sunk Cost Fallacy Influences Our Decisions • Asana](https://asana.com/resources/sunk-cost-fallacy)

but what about

example:

gym membership: 1 month = xx amount of money.


if you go, then good.
some people do not enjoy going to the gym.

But some think, oh I already paid for it. Might as well.
I don't want to waste my money.

They continued going to the gym at least once a week for a month.

The next month they won a free gym membership for another month because of a gym-wide lottery.
This person was planning on not enrolling for the next month because they don't like going to the gym because it makes them uncomfortable.

They thought, ah this would have costed me xx amount of money and I'm getting it for free.
This is an unpredicted good fortune.

Might as well use it.


With that decision to stick to it, although it isn't the most fun for them to go the gym, they developed a habit of going to the gym regularly and in a few years they became the fittest they've ever been.


If I think about it like that, in this situation, does the sunk cost fallacy still apply?
Does it apply in a way I don't understand?

Maybe I'm just really sleepy and can't think straight right now at 2 am?

I need someone patient to help me understand even if I ask ridiculous answers.
People close to me dislike my being "philosophical" or what other term they use to describe my "stupid/moronic/common sense" questions.
Are they really common sense?

Then if I do not have common sense that they have, how will I ever acquire it if they do not take the time to explain it to me?

Why do they become so impatient with my questions?
Why are they easily irritated?

Are they easily irritated or am I just really irritating?

But I really want to know. Not to fight. Not to fight! Just to find other perspectives and challenge answers because my brain starts thinking on another tangent.

I must adjust my manner of asking?


Am I asking for the sake of asking?
Is that a bad thing?

Should I stop asking questions?


They say it isn't bad to ask questions but when "too many questions" are asked suddenly it's a whole different game and I'm purposefully trying to go against everything.

But I was told that I'm obedient for the most part -- by other figures.

benefit of the doubt

the benefit of the doubt is that it's just that, a doubt!
lucky you it doesn't have tangible or substantial evidence that weighing on that doubt you have on your mind because now you can give the benefit of the doubt.
