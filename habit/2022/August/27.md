<summary>thoughts</summary>
- i want to learn how to code! <br>
- the eras of japan and their significance
<br>
- other thoughts

<br>

- Each one of us has value. <br> My brother tells me not to be so trustful and kind to people. <br><br> He tells me that I trust too easily. <br><br> Why should I be so skeptical of everyone? <br><br> I always think back to the <mark> Golden Rule </Mark>. <br> Do unto others what you want others to do unto you. <br><br> 
Well then, if I were in the position of the lady that would have liked to stay in our house because she lived in a dilapidated shelter where children throw rocks at her, I would have tried to find another home. 
I would have wanted someone to take me in to help me get back on my feet. 
That's what I would have wanted had I been in the shoes of that lady.
 What simple thing we could have done to do to help the lady. <br><br> 
 But my brother says we do not know her.<br> Our doorway security is lax. <br>That she could be a murderer for all we know. <br><br>
But why do we have to think ill of someone? <br>
Why do we have to be quick to judge> <br> Isn't that a bad thing to do?
<br>
He says it is the way of the world. <br>
He says that the world is not good.

    <br>
    If I were that judged person, I would be hurt. <br>
    That goes against the golden rule. <br>
    This would go against what I would want done for myself. <br>

    Therefore, I would like to give this lady the benefit of the doubt. <br>
    I am not allowed to, to err on the safe side. <br>
    <br><br>


    <br>
    How do you gauge if a person is worth your time and help? <br>
    How do you know when to help? <br>
    How do you know if you should help? <br>
    How do you know if a person is bad?<br>
    How do you stay safe from bad people if you have faith in people?
