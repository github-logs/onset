## Did You Know?

_Adjure_ comes, by way of [Anglo-French](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Anglo-French), from the Latin verb _adjūrāre_, which means “to affirm with an oath” or “to swear.” The root of _adjūrāre_ is _jūrāre_, which means “to swear”; that word is also the source of [_jury_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jury) (“a body of persons sworn to give a verdict on some matter submitted to them”) and [_juror_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juror) (“a member of a jury”). In English, “to adjure” can mean to command someone as if under oath or the penalty of a curse, but the word is more commonly used in the sense of “to urge or advise earnestly,” and is synonymous with the somewhat more familiar verbs [_entreat_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entreat), [_importune_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/importune), and [_implore_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implore).
