	- [ ] what happened to [learn how to make games?]
	- [ ] what happened to [study for an hour everyday - acco]
	- [ ] what happened to [figure out where to get the updated curriculum sheet?]
		答え：working on it, looking for updates, asking around

	- [ ] what happened to [figuring out what you really want to do with your life]
		I guess there's no winning. Most people never find out what they want to do with their lives or the tangent they went through is completely different from what they expected/planned for/imagined. So please, goodness me, stop worrying about it so much.
