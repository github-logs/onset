	- [ ] what happened to [learn how to make games?]
	- [ ] what happened to [study for an hour everyday - acco]
	- [ ] what happened to [figure out where to get the updated curriculum sheet?]
		答え：working on it, looking for updates, asking around

	- [ ] what happened to [figuring out what you really want to do with your life]
		I guess there's no winning. Most people never find out what they want to do with their lives or the tangent they went through is completely different from what they expected/planned for/imagined. So please, goodness me, stop worrying about it so much.

<summary> 気分</summary>
i feel horrible because i asked for new sandals and they cost a lot but they're much better for my feet because they actually fit me and these sandals seem to be studied by orthopedic doctors or something.'

i feel bad because my father is hiding something from me on his phone.
he is texting someone.
he thinks he is being clever about it but it's too obvious that he's hiding something.

he got angry at me for suggesting that i stay inside the coffeeshop until late. I didn't think my suggestion was out of the ordinary since he's left me at coffeeshops until 9 pm many times before.
he asked me who I'm meeting because I'd like to stay there so late.
I don't know how to commute anyway so what does it matter.

I don't even have much friends and I am always transparent about everything because they've always been strict with me and my siblings.

a few hours later, i realized that

only a guilty person would accuse someone of that.
statistically, partners who accuse their partners of cheating are the ones cheating themselves,

So what excuse is there still?

while at the bank, his movements are rushed as he checked on me. He is in a hurry.
he decided oh, why don't we go to the other bank.

this bank is closed too. 

unluckily all the banks are offline, on a national level.
must be some kind of hacker trying to get in to get other peoples money and the bank is trying to do something about it.

then he decides to spend a little bit of the money, that's supposed to be deposited, for gas.


the pattern arises again.

he suddenly lashes out, then at the blow of the wind he acts all nice and pleasant.

ma<br>
pag<br>
balat
ka<br>
yo<br>

is the first word that comes to mind.


I don't know.

There's the good and there's the bad. It's never all black and white. It's always gray.
And I hate it, 

I hate the complexity of it because it gets more difficult to tell what's right from wrong for me. Because I go through a moral dilemma inside my head and even in there it doesn't make much sense because I'm not that smart either.
Choices.

I hate that I don't hate it completely.

Choices. A gift and a curse.

This question always comes to mind.

Do we really have a choice.
We don't have choices in many things like our race, our country, our parents relationships, our parents' financial stability at the time they had children, environmental factors as a child, our upbringing, the ability of a parent or parents to parent their child in the way the child needs.



<br>
<br>

I am angry. I am mad that he only treats us like a person when he knows he is doing a sin, when he knows he is guilty of something. He does this as a way to make up for it on his own mind. 

Although that's not really the case. He knows this too, but this is what he does to ease the guilt.
