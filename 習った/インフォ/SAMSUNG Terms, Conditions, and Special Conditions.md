10. Software updates and availability of Services
10.1 With the “Automatic Update” function enabled (as in the default setting in the System Update menu in the Setting), Samsung’s software that you utilize for the Services may automatically download and install updates from Samsung from time to time. These updates may improve, enhance and further develop the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules or completely new versions. You agree to receive and allow Samsung to deliver such updates to you as part of your use of the Services. If you have chosen to disable the “Automatic Update” function, then you can check the availability of new Updates by clicking on the “Check Update” menu in the Setting. Given the importance of receiving Updates for security software in a timely manner to defend against new threats, however, security-related Updates may be automatically downloaded and installed without your consent, even if you have disabled the “Automatic Update” function. We recommend that you check availability of any new Updates periodically for optimal use of your device.
