in the form of embedded software on a Logitech product; (iii) any related documentation,
modified versions of, upgrades or improvements to such software (unless expressly provided
under different terms at the time of update or download), all subsequent versions, copies of

These terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other legal rights in addition,
which vary depending on the jurisdiction.
1. License.
Subject to the terms of this EULA, Logitech grants you a limited, nonexclusive license to use the
Software, solely with the Logitech product you have purchased or the Logitech service used by
you. Except for embedded software on a Logitech product, the Software may be copied only for
backup or archive purposes in support of your use of the Software as permitted hereunder and
to make it available on an internal household or internal enterprise network server solely for
downloading onto devices in your possession or control within your household or enterprise; but
solely for your use of the Software as provided herein. Any copies must include all copyright and
other proprietary notices contained in the original. For embedded Software on a Logitech
product, you may only use one (1) copy, solely on the Logitech product in your possession or
control or with the Logitech service used by you. You may permanently transfer to another
person the Software upon a permanent transfer of the Logitech product using the Software, so
long as that person agrees to be bound by this EULA, and following such transfer you stop
using the product and the Software.
2. Restrictions.

(except as expressly permitted in Section 1), distribute, host, outsource, disclose or otherwise
commercially exploit the Software or make the Software available to any third party; (B) copy

4. Automatic Software Updates.
Logitech may from time to time provide bug fixes, updates, upgrades and other modifications to
the Software (“Updates”). These may be automatically installed without providing any additional
notice or receiving any additional consent. You consent to these automatic Updates. If you do
not want such Updates, your remedy is to stop using the Product. The terms of this EULA will
govern any Updates provided by Logitech that replace and/or supplement the original Software,
unless such Updates are accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that
license will govern.
5. Application Store.
If you have downloaded the Software from an application market or store, such as Apple App
Store, Apple Mac Store or Google Play (“App Store”), you are also subject to any terms of use
of that App Store. If your use of the Software is subject to an App Store’s terms of use, then in
the event of any conflict or ambiguity between the App Store’s terms of use and this EULA, the
App Store’s terms of use will govern, but only to the extent necessary to resolve such conflict or
ambiguity, and the terms of this EULA will otherwise remain in full force and effect. You
acknowledge that (i) this EULA is concluded between Logitech and You, and not with the App
Store; (ii) the App Store has no obligation to furnish any support or maintenance whatsoever in
relation to any Software downloaded therefrom; (iii) Logitech, not the App Store, will be
responsible as provided in this EULA, to the extent not disclaimed, for any product warranty,
product claims and intellectual property claims for the Software downloaded from an App Store.
In any event, the App Store’s maximum liability for any warranty will be the refund of the
purchase price (if any) for the Software; (iv) Apple and its subsidiaries are third party
beneficiaries of this EULA for Software downloaded from the Apple App Store and the Mac
Store.

Our privacy practices are described in our Privacy Policy, as well as in separate privacy
statements (collectively, the “Privacy Policy”) provided when a software, an app, a product or
service is purchased, downloaded or used. By installing the Software, using Logitech products

EVEN IF LOGITECH HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN
NO CASE WILL LOGITECH'S AND ITS LICENSORS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE
ACTUAL MONEY PAID FOR THE LOGITECH PRODUCT, SOFTWARE, OR SERVICE GIVING
RISE TO THE LIABILITY. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy
fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

applicable law requires such liability.
